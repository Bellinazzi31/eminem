            <h1>Eminem</h1>
            <p>
                Rapper, actor and music producer Eminem is one of the best-selling musicians
            of the 21st century and one of the most influential rappers of all time.
            Born Marshall Bruce Mathers III in 1972 in Missouri, Eminem had a turbulent
            childhood. He dropped out of school in the ninth grade and worked odd jobs
            until finally making it as a rapper upon the release of The Slim Shady LP in early 1999.
            The album went multi-platinum, garnering Eminem two Grammy Awards and four MTV Video Music Awards. 
            In 2000, Eminem released The Marshall Mathers LP, which was noted as the fastest-selling album in rap history. 
            Two years later, he delivered the Academy Award-winning song "Lose Yourself," from the semi-autobiographical drama 8 Mile.
            </p>
            <p>In 2010, he released the Grammy-winning album Recovery, a highly autobiographical attempt to come to terms with his struggles with addiction and experience with rehabilitation. 

            The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013) also garnered numerous accolades, and the rapper later followed with Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018) and Music to Be Murdered By (2020).

            <h2>Lose Yourself</h2>
            <p>Look
                If you had
                One shot
                Or one opportunity
                To seize everything you ever wanted
                In one moment
                Would you capture it
                Or just let it slip?
            </p>
            <p>    
                Yo
                His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
                There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
                He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
                To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
                What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
                He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
                He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
                The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
                Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
                Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
                He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
                He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
                It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
                He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
                Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
            </p>
